										<h1>Meaningless</h1>

									<p>When I was born I guess my parents were happy. Although I never saw them because they died when I was young, that's what everyone say. Also, I have no track of my age so taking the age of the boys I grew up within consideration I guess I'm 25 right now. But we came too far here let's slide back to the time when I was a kid.</p>

                                       <p> So, I grew up an orphan and had no other family. Growing up, I always thought about the meaning of life. We are born to do stuff according to others until we die and then end of the story. But in my case, I had no one who would say what to do and no one to expect anything from me so, I never knew how it felt to live that way.</p>
                                        
                                       <p> When I look back into my life, I see that I tried and failed in so many things. In school, I always used to get bad grades and because of that, I couldn't get into good universities to study further. And when I tried to join the army, I couldn't get through it either, because of a low BMI.
                                            What a bummer! And from that day onwards I started thinking about the main motive of my existence.</p>
                                        
                                       <p> I never made anyone proud and I've no one to make proud. So, I never knew the feeling of proudness. I never got the motive in my life to do any work. I really wonder, is it because I never saw my parents or is it just me? The way I'm. So different from others.</p>
                                        
                                       <p> I tried so hard to build emotions inside me. To feel what it is like to be sad or how it feels to be filled with happiness. What is the meaning of being happy? But in the end, I would lose the motive to do so. By the way, I was supposed to talk about my childhood and all I'm doing is looking for the answers and the meaning of being alive.</p> 
                                        
                                       <p> In my youth days, everyone was talking about falling in love and they would describe it as a season of spring when everything looks beautiful and feels comfortable. I never felt that as well. I used to think that it's all in their heads. And I saw what being sad looked like when the old granny who used to take care of all the children 
                                           in the orphanage died. Everyone was crying. Out of courtesy and also fear because everyone was staring at me as if they would eat me alive, I too tried but I couldn't shed a single tear for her. But sadness too is for a temporary basis. That's what I observed from others. You might be thinking what an emotionless fool I'm.</p>
                                        
                                       <p> I can laugh though. Laughing is an action where you open your mouth and start producing the sound of "HaHaHa!" And it's easy. I mean all you need to do is an action, doesn't matter if you feel anything or not.
                                        Is it true that no feeling stays longer? Even if you are depressed at some point, the tension takes over you and later the sadness and if you fight back, the happiness comes around which I guess stays less with people as they move on so quickly.</p>
                                        
                                       <p> All my life, I tried to find answers for myself and for my existence. I don't have any motive for being alive so being dead is the option I chose but that too feels meaningless.
                                        I guess even if you are feeling low, sad, depressed, or happy is all because you have meaning in your life. Someone who can feel all these emotions is lucky because that person is invested in something and is getting something in return.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>I'm tired of finding the meaning of my life so that I can feel something. But the journey of finding the meaning of life, led me to the motive of my life, to know what impact my existence had made to the world where I live. And this is the
                                           true motive of mine. This is what makes me alive. I may not be good at studies or may not be able to get into the army but still, I have a job to find my true self, my own identity. And this what brings a smile on my face. The Journey. And where it led me. </p>
