									<p>For years I have struggled with depression and anxiety and loneliness.
									 I've distanced myself from almost everyone in my life because of it. Friends abandoned me when I needed them the most, the family became quiet, and I detached myself from everyone because of it. I didn't want to hurt anyone else because I was hurting myself.
									 I would be pushing people away without realizing it, losing myself because of it, stuffing down my feelings till it began to kill me and take over my head. I was all alone with seemingly no one to turn to. I didn't want to take anyone else down with me. 
									 So I became quite too. 
									</p>
									<p>
									I faked a smile, and distanced myself from people whom I knew didn't care about me and my mental health. But what I didn't realize is that I was also pushing away people who actually cared. Cause I cared about them too much, I didn't want to hurt them too. 
									I am at my lowest in my life. A few weeks ago, I attempted suicide because of it but here I am. Still suffering more than my brain can wrap itself around, more than I can contain. 
									I felt every emotion, every word, every pain. I felt everything. I cried for everything.
									I made something inspired by it, and I listen to it every day. It reminds me of how you pulled yourself out of the dark time, and I hope I can do it too.</p>
